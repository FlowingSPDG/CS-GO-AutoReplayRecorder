### About
CSGO Auto Replay Recorder/Player for live-production,WIP!  
You should setup two CSGO-Client(Live-Kill collector/Delayed-ClipRecorder). and insecured CSGO server with GOTV.  
You may need vmix that support "Instant Replay" feature(vmix-4K or vmix-PRO). other softweres are not supported yet.  
also I'm planning to implement this on OBS-Studio and NewTek 3Play(only if I had chance to test it).
